# Hisham Joha Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website hosted at [hisham-joha.github.io](https://hisham-joha.github.io). This project showcases my skills as a web developer with a modern, interactive design inspired by a "Spider Web" theme.

## Overview

This portfolio is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a full-screen layout with smooth scrolling, a dynamic spider web background, and interactive navigation buttons. The content highlights my background, a key project, and contact information.

### Features
- **Full-Screen Sections**: Each section (Home, About, Projects, Contact, Footer) occupies the entire viewport.
- **Dynamic Spider Web Background**: A moving spider web effect created with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript.
- **Flash Slide Transitions**: Smooth animations between sections triggered by scrolling.
- **Navigation Buttons**: Three buttons in the header for quick access to About, Projects, and Contact sections.

- **Auto-Updating Year**: The copyright year in the footer updates automatically based on the current year.

## Technologies Used
